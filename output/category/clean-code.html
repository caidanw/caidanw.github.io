<p>Organize the names we give to our variables, methods, classes, arguments, and packages by following some simple rules
(longer descriptions at the bottom). I refer to these coding objects that I give names as "entities" to keep it simple.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The name should fully reveal the intent of its use.</li>
<li>Names should not misinform the reader.</li>
<li>Have meaningful distinctions in the name</li>
<li>Try to make the names pronounceable names when possible, this will help significantly once you start programming
    with others.</li>
<li>Use names that are easy to find by search.</li>
<li>No encodings, it can be messy, misleading, and hard to find in a search.</li>
<li>It's a waste of time to prefix member variables.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Rules Explained:</h3>
<p><strong>Names with intent</strong><br>
Take time when trying to determine a name. Think about the variable,
method, etc.  and the purpose of it being created, what use it serves
(within the project's scope), and how it is used.  </p>
<p>PS: If it needs a comment (near its declaration to describe) what it is,
then rename it.</p>
<p><strong>Don't misinform</strong><br>
Entities will be read by both yourself and possibly other people in the
future. So a name that misinforms the reader about the entity will be
hard to know it's purpose at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful Distinctions</strong><br>
This is fairly simple, just don't use characters that look like others
if they are not in a word/group. Here is an example of how the lowercase
L can be confused with the number 1.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mo">01</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">l</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">O1</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Searchable name</strong><br>
Avoid using names that contain single letters and single digits, as this
is harder to search for across a project. If single letters must be
used, say for temporary variables, then only use them as local variables
in short methods.</p>
<p><strong>No encodings</strong><br>
An example of bad encoding, which is illogical, confusing, and is not helpful
for anyone other than the programmer that wrote it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">Z7_DaysLeft</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">23</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Prefix member variables</strong><br>
There is no need to prefix variables that belong to a class because your
classes (and functions) should be small enough that you wouldn't need to
organize them. They are also easily ignored after a period of time
working with them while making the code look really messy.<br>
---<br>
Example of a prefixed member variable</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Barrel</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">m_weightInLbs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">23</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>Wise Words and Quotes:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s
actually a List. The word list means something specific to
programmers. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a
List, it may lead to false conclusions. So accountGroup or
bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better."</p>
<p>- Robert C. Martin</p>
<p>"The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope."</p>
<p>- Robert C. Martin</p>
