I've been coding since I was 13, and I've developed everything from video games to mobile apps to internal tools. I'm an autodidact and I love to learn new things, I am fully self taught but I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Game Development to be more easily recognized by game companies. I'm looking to expand my knowledge and dive into other technologies, as I have a deep passion for programming and learning. I can learn new languages and frameworks quickly, this reduces the time it takes for me to get familiar with a new tech stack and allows me to start contributing sooner. I've been coding for the last 8 years, with 2 of those years being professional.
