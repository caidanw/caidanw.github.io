I've been creating mini digital worlds and tools since ~2012, and started my professional career in 2018. I've dabbled with developing everything from video games to mobile apps to internal tools. Some might say that I'm an autodidact and have a passion for learning new things. I am fully self-taught with the exception of a brief one semester stint of community college.

If you'd like to see my work experience or personal projects, my social links are below and my resume is top-right.
