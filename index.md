Hi, I am a 20 year old college student currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Computer Science, while working full-time for GitPrime Inc.

I've been coding since I was 13, and I've developed everything from video games to e-commerce shops. I'm looking to expand my knowledge and dive into other technologies, as I have a deep passion for programming and learning. I can learn new languages and frameworks quickly, this reduces the time it takes for me to get familiar with a new tech stack and allows me to start contributing sooner. I've been coding for the last 8 years, with 2 of those years being professional.

If you'd like to see my work experience or personal projects, you can find my social links below.

**Job Status: I am open to opportunities for full-time work with relocation in the greater Seattle area.**
