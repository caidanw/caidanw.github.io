# About

_Ludum Dare 45 Entry created using Pixi.js_ \| [Ludum Dare Entry Page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/unlock-hero)

I created all the art, a few of the sound effects, and some of the code. This project is not meant to display code quality but rather getting a project finished with a deadline of 72 hours starting from scratch.
