I've been meaning to build a personal website for years. Not a portfolio template, not a hosted blog platform, but something **truly mine**. Last month, I finally sat down and did it. Here's what I learned along the way.

## Why Build From Scratch?

The obvious question is _why bother?_ Services like Medium, Substack, and countless website builders exist. They're polished, they handle hosting, and they let you focus on writing. But I wanted something different.

Building from scratch gives you **complete control**, _deep understanding_, and **_genuine ownership_** of your content. No algorithms deciding who sees your work. No ~~platform lock-in~~ worrying about a company pivoting away from your needs.

## The Technology Stack

Choosing the right tools took longer than I expected. Here's where I landed:

### Framework Selection

After evaluating several options, I chose Astro for its simplicity and performance focus.

#### Why Not React?

React felt like overkill for a mostly-static site. I don't need client-side state management for blog posts.

##### Performance Considerations

Static HTML loads faster, uses less bandwidth, and works without JavaScript enabled.

###### A Note on Progressive Enhancement

The site works everywhere, then enhances where possible.

## My Development Process

Building the site followed a fairly standard workflow:

1. Set up the project structure
2. Design the layout in code
3. Build core components
   1. Navigation header
   2. Blog post template
4. Add content and iterate

Along the way, I kept a running list of features I wanted:

- Markdown-based blog posts
- Syntax highlighting for code
- Dark mode support
  - System preference detection
  - Manual toggle option
- RSS feed generation

### Current Progress

Looking at my original feature list:

- [x] Completed task
- [x] Basic blog functionality
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] RSS feed

## Lessons Learned

A few things surprised me during this project. As [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net) once wrote:

This advice kept me moving forward when I got stuck on minor details.

## Technical Deep Dive

For the developers reading this, here's how the blog post rendering works. Each post includes inline configuration like `const isDraft = true;` in the frontmatter.

The main rendering function looks like this:

```javascript
function renderPost(markdown) {
  const { frontmatter, content } = parseMarkdown(markdown)
  if (frontmatter.draft && !isDevelopment) return null
  return generateHTML(content)
}

console.log(renderPost(myFirstPost)) // <article>...</article>
```

Styling uses straightforward CSS with sensible defaults:

```css
.blog-post {
  max-width: 65ch;
  margin: 0 auto;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
```

## Comparing Approaches

I evaluated several static site generators before deciding:

| Generator | Build Speed | Learning Curve | Flexibility |
| --------- | :---------: | -------------- | ----------: |
| Astro     |    Fast     | Low            |        High |
| Next.js   |   Medium    | Medium         |   Very High |
| Hugo      |  Very Fast  | Medium         |      Medium |
| Jekyll    |    Slow     | Low            |     Limited |

Each has trade-offs. For my needs, Astro hit the sweet spot.

## What's Next

The site is live, but it's far from finished. I'm planning to add more interactive elements, improve the design, and most importantly, write more. A website is only as good as its content.

Building this site reminded me why I fell in love with web development in the first place. There's something deeply satisfying about crafting something from nothing, seeing it come together piece by piece, and knowing that every decision was intentional.

If you've been putting off building your own site, consider this your sign. Start small, ship early, and iterate. The tools have never been better, and the web needs more personal corners.
