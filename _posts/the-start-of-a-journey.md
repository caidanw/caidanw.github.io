Hello, friend.

This is a start, one which will help shape the next portion of my life.
The purpose of this blog is more of a digital notebook to keep track of
my progress, so I may reflect later upon this and see my improvement. I
will be tracking my computer science learning, specifically programming
and software development. Any being is welcome to learn and take away
what they can from this blog.

Goodbye for now and remember, *smile\!*
